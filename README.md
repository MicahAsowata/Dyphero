# Dyphero
A decryptor based on the Caesar Cipher
## How to use

Call the function

    `dyphero(cipher_text='some text', key=A number)`

The output should be: 

    `Decrypted value of the cipher text`

## Notes

The outputted plain text is not on one line. (Still haven't figured why yet. :smirk:)

Otherwise,
